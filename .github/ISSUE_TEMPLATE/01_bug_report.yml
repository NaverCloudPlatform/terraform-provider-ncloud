        # Configuration and Logging

        Please include all Terraform configurations required to reproduce the bug. Bug reports without a functional reproduction may be closed without investigation.

        Terraform configurations or debug logs under 25MB may be [attached directly in the field](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files). Files larger than this should be uploaded to a file hosting service and a link shared.

        For your security, you can also encrypt the files using our GPG public key: https://keybase.io/hashicorp 
        
        **Note:** These form fields do not automatically render, so you will need to use [code fence(s)](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code) to achieve proper formatting.
