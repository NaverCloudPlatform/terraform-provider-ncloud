        # Thank you for opening a feature request!

        This form is intended as a way to request additional functionality for resources, data sources, or the provider itself. This may include requests such as adding additional arguments or attributes enabled by upstream API changes, additional validation for arguments, entirely new resource or data source, etc.

        When possible, it's helpful to check the [NCLOUD Go SDKv2](https://github.com/NaverCloudPlatform/ncloud-sdk-go-v2) to determine whether functionality exists to enable the requested feature. It is **not** required that you do this. Any references found when searching can be added to the "References" field below to give maintainers or the community a head start.

        Please update the title to match what you're requesting, e.g.:

        - `[New Resource]:` - for new resource requests
        - `[New Data Source]:` - for new data source requests

        If this request was implemented, what might the Terraform configuration look like? A best guess is helpful, even if you're unsure of exactly what the end result will look like. This helps maintainers and the community better understand how you (someone who is in need of this feature) envisions it.
