# Resource: ncloud_mongodb

Provides a Database Service MongoDB resource.

~> **NOTE:** This resource only supports VPC environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ncloud_vpc" "vpc" {
  name            = "vpc"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "ncloud_subnet" "subnet" {
  vpc_no         = ncloud_vpc.vpc.id
  subnet         = "10.0.1.0/24"
  zone           = "KR-1"
  network_acl_no = ncloud_vpc.vpc.default_network_acl_no
  subnet_type    = "PRIVATE"
  name           = "subnet-01"
  usage_type     = "GEN"
}

resource "ncloud_mongodb" "mongodb" {
  vpc_no = ncloud_vpc.vpc.id
  subnet_no = ncloud_subnet.subnet.id
  service_name = "sample-mongodb"
  server_name_prefix = "tf-svr"
  user_name = "username"
  user_password = "password1!"

## Import

### `terraform import` command

* MongoDB can be imported using the `id`. For example:

```console
$ terraform import ncloud_mongodb.rsc_name 12345
```

### `import` block

* In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import MongoDB using the `id`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = ncloud_mongodb.rsc_name
  id = "12345"
}
```
