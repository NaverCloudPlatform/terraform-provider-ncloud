  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu"]
  }
}

data "ncloud_sourcebuild_project_os_runtimes" "runtimes" {
  os_id = data.ncloud_sourcebuild_project_os.os.os[0].id

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["base"]
  }
}

data "ncloud_sourcebuild_project_os_runtime_versions" "runtime_versions" {
  os_id      = data.ncloud_sourcebuild_project_os.os.os[0].id
  runtime_id = data.ncloud_sourcebuild_project_os_runtimes.runtimes.runtimes[0].id

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["16.04-1.0.0"]
  }
}

output "lookup-runtime_versions-output" {
  value = data.ncloud_sourcebuild_project_os_runtime_versions.runtime_versions.runtime_versions
}
```
