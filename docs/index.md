# Ncloud Provider

The Ncloud provider is used to interact with
[Ncloud](https://www.ncloud.com) (NAVER Cloud Platform) services.
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.


## Example Usage

```hcl
// Configure the ncloud provider
provider "ncloud" {
  access_key = var.access_key
  secret_key = var.secret_key
  region     = var.region
  site       = var.site
}

// Create a new server instance
resource "ncloud_server" "server" {
  # ...
}
```

## Authentication


The Ncloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication.
The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

### Static credentials ###

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `access_key` `secret_key` `region` and `site` in-line in the
ncloud provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "ncloud" {
  access_key = var.access_key
  secret_key = var.secret_key
  region     = var.region
  site       = var.site
}
```


###Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via `NCLOUD_ACCESS_KEY` and `NCLOUD_SECRET_KEY`,
environment variables, representing your Ncloud Access Key and Secret Key, respectively.
`NCLOUD_REGION` is also used, if applicable:

```hcl
provider "ncloud" {}
```

Usage:

```shell
$ export NCLOUD_ACCESS_KEY="accesskey"
$ export NCLOUD_SECRET_KEY="secretkey"
$ export NCLOUD_REGION="KR"
$ terraform plan
```
